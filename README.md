# SkinFetcher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kacperduras/SkinFetcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kacperduras/SkinFetcher)
Repair skins for premium players on BungeeCord.

## Philosophy

#### 1. It "Just works"
Fully automated, ready to work - immediately after installation, without any unnecessary configuration.

#### 2. No magic
The plugin was written in a completely understandable and simple way, without unnecessary *macrofilling*.

#### 3. Stability
The project was written in such a way that it does not cause problems when it comes to failure.

#### 4. Very small
Why generate unnecessary server load?

## Configuration
```yaml
debug: false
```
